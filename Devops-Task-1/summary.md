### Summary
In this task, I set up a Linux environment and explored basic Linux system operations using the command-line interface. The objective was to become comfortable navigating the Linux file system, managing files and permissions, and monitoring system resources.

### Linux Environment
- Operating System: Ubuntu 25.10 ( Local VM)
- Interface Used: Terminal (CLI)

### Key Concepts Learned

#### 1. Linux Directory Structure
- Understood the difference between root (`/`) and home (`~`) directories.
- Explored important system directories such as `/bin`, `/etc`, `/usr`, `/var`, and `/home`.

#### 2. File and Directory Management
- Created and removed directories using `mkdir` and `rm -r`.
- Created files using `touch` and edited them using `nano`.
- Viewed file contents using `cat` and `less`.

#### 3. File Permissions and Ownership
- Learned how to view file permissions using `ls -l`.
- Modified file permissions using `chmod`.
- Understood read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) permissions.
- Gained basic understanding of file ownership using `chown`.

#### 4. System Monitoring
- Monitored running processes and CPU usage using `top`.
- Checked disk usage using `df -h`.
- Viewed memory utilization using `free -m`.
